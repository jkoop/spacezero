# SpaceZero

SpaceZero is a Real Time Strategy 2D space combat game for two players over a network.

+ The objective is to conquer the universe, defeating all enemies.
+ At starting point you have only one ship and one planet, but you have gold to buy more ships to conquer more planets.
+ All ships can be controlled by the computer (automatic mode) or by the player (manual mode). You can easily change among your ships, controlling all of them independently.
